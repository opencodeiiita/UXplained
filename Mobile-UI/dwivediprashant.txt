-- BRIEF EXPLANATION ABOUT DESIGN LAWS AND PRINCIPLES USED IN THE DESIGN --


Visual Hierarchy: Size, color, and weight prioritize key elements like progress, CTAs, and play buttons to guide user attention instantly.

Gestalt Law of Proximity: Related items (course info, progress, actions) are grouped in cards, making information easy to scan and understand.

Contrast: Strong color contrast highlights primary actions and active states, improving clarity and focus.

Fitts’s Law: Large buttons and navigation targets reduce interaction effort and mis-taps on mobile.

Consistency & Repetition: Repeated card layouts, progress bars, and navigation patterns improve learnability and usability.

Hick’s Law: Limited visible options per screen reduce cognitive load and speed up decision-making.

Alignment & Grid: Clean alignment creates visual order and professional structure.

Visibility of System Status: Progress indicators and online status provide continuous user feedback.
