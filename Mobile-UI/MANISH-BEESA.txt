Design laws and principles used in the design : 

Visual Hierarchy: Size, color, and font weight emphasize important elements like course titles, progress, and action buttons.
Gestalt Law of Proximity: Related information is grouped in cards, making content easy to scan and understand.
Contrast: Strong contrast between background, text, and buttons improves readability and focus.
Fitts’s Law: Large buttons and navigation targets reduce interaction effort on mobile devices.
Consistency & Repetition: Repeated layouts, buttons, and navigation patterns improve usability and learnability.
Hick’s Law: Limited options per screen reduce cognitive load and speed up user decision-making.
