Approach:
I created screens that user would like to watch, by applying Laws of UI/UX

I have additionaly created - settings screen, notifications screen, resources screen

UI/UX Laws Applied:- 

Visual hierarchy - added proper hierarchy
Consistency & repetition - consistent styling and colours
Hick’s Law - Appealing screens
Fitts’s Law - Appealing buttons
Accessibility basics - Proper alignment
