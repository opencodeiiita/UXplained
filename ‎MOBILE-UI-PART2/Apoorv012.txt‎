DESIGN LAWS AND PRINCIPLES USED IN THE DESIGN:
- Hick’s Law: Limited options reduce cognitive load and allow users to make decisions faster.
- Fitts’s Law: Large elements and bottom navigation reduce effort and mis-taps
- Visual Hierarchy: Size, color, spacing, and typography prioritize key elements such as batch cards, progress indicators, and primary actions, guiding user attention effectively.
- Contrast & Readability: Clear contrast between text, backgrounds, and interactive elements improves readability and highlights important actions.
- Consistency & Repetition: Repeated layouts, icons, navigation patterns, and progress indicators across screens improve learnability and user confidence.
- Alignment
