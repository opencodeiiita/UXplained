Left side (Bad Proximity):

	-The labels “Google Search” and “Date” are far from the elements they relate to.
	-Color blocks and input boxes are scattered, making it harder to understand grouping.

Right side (Good Proximity):

	-Related items (like “Date” and “Google Search”) are closer to their respective input 		fields.
	-Elements that belong together are visually grouped.
	-White space is used effectively to separate groups without confusion.

Overall, the right side clearly communicates grouping and relationships, making it much easier for a user to scan and interact with.
