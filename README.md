## 🚀 What is UXplained?

UXplained is an interactive design repository where **abstract UI/UX laws** become **practical mini-projects**.

Instead of boring theory dumps, you:

- Design screens ✨
- Build components 🧩
- Create animations 🎞️
- Understand *why* good design works

Think of it as a **design gym** — small reps, real skills, visible growth.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Repo

To help learners:

- Understand core UI/UX laws intuitively
- Apply design principles through real visuals
- Build a strong design portfolio with meaningful work
- Learn by doing (not memorizing)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Each **Issue** focuses on **one UI/UX law**.

Every issue includes:

- 📘 A simple explanation of the law
- 🛠️ A design task (UI / component / animation)
- 🏷️ Tags (Open-for-all / Competitive)
- ⭐ Points (for motivation & fun)

You can use **Figma, Framer, After Effects, or any design tool** you like.

---

## 🧩 Issues & Challenges

All design challenges are listed as **GitHub Issues**.

Each issue focuses on **one UI/UX law or concept** and gives you a task to explore it visually.

👉 Details, rules, and expectations for each challenge are explained **inside the issue itself**, so the README stays clean and easy to skim.

Pick an issue that excites you, not the one that feels easiest.

🤖 You can use AI. Seriously — no guilt, no drama.

But here’s the real thing I want you to remember:

AI can help you **understand**, but *you* have to **decide**.

AI can give ideas, but *you* give taste.

AI can suggest, but *you* create.

***Don’t design what’s easiest to generate.***

***Design what helps you think more, see better, and grow as a designer.***

Your curiosity, your mistakes, your iterations — that’s where the learning lives.

Tools will change. Your creative thinking shouldn’t.

## 🧠 A Small Note Before You Start

Don’t do what’s fastest.

Do what:

- Teaches you something new
- Pushes you slightly out of comfort
- Makes you think like a designer

Messy attempts > perfect shortcuts.

Experience is the real reward.
