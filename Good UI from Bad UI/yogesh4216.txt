Description: I moved away from the cluttered, texture-heavy original to a clean, flat aesthetic that prioritizes clarity. The dashboard now uses a spacious grid layout for instant readability, while the promotions page swaps dense text for well-spaced cards, making the content much easier to scan. By shifting to a modern blue gradient theme and removing the visual noise, the interface feels significantly more polished and user-friendly.
